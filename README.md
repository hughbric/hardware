A curated list of resources for MA students interested in hardware

## Getting Started

### Arduino

Manufacturer link | [Arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/)

Arduinos are a fantastic tool for prototyping. They are cheap and easily accessible (you can buy from specialist electronics suppliers or big chains like Amazon.)

**Resources:**

* [Adafruit's Arduino Tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/learn-arduino)

### Raspberry Pi

Manufacturer link | [Raspberrypi.org/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

The Raspberry Pi is actually a very cheap computer that you could attach peripherals to and use it for your basic computing needs. Pis can be used in a range of hardware projects, and are popular choices for home automation.

## MCUs

The 'brain' on something like an Arduino looks like this:
